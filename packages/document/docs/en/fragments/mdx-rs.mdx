:::tip NOTICE
The bottom layer of this function is based on the [@rspress/mdx-rs-binding](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/mdx-rs-binding) library developed by Rspress. The performance is **10+** times higher than the JS version of the MDX compiler, but the JS version of the plugin is not yet supported. If you need to add a custom remark or rehype plugin, it is not recommended to enable this function.
