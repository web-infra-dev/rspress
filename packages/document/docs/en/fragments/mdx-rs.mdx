Whether to use the Rust version of the MDX compiler. For example:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    // Switch to the JS version of the compiler
    mdxRs: false,
  },
});
```

You can also provide a function to determine which files use the Rust version of MDX compiler. For example:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    mdxRs: {
      include: (filepath: string) => filepath.includes('foo.mdx'),
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip NOTICE
The bottom layer of `mdxRs` is based on the [@rspress/mdx-rs-binding](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/mdx-rs) library developed by Rspress. The performance is **10+** times higher than the JS version of the MDX compiler, but the JS version of the plugin is not yet supported.
