# @rspress/plugin-preview

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

> [Source Code](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspress/tree/main/packages/plugin-preview)

Used to preview components in the code block of md(x) files.

## Installation

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rspress/plugin-preview -D" />

## Usage

### Register

First, write the following config in the config file:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';
import { pluginPreview } from '@rspress/plugin-preview';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pluginPreview()],
});
```

:::warning Note

After adding this plugin, please set `markdown.mdxRs` to `false`, otherwise it will cause the plugin to fail.

### Internal Components

The component code of internal components is declared in the mdx file. You can declare the following code block in the mdx file:

````mdx
```tsx
function App() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}

export default App;
```
````

It's worth noting that you need to export the component as default, and Rspress will automatically render this component.

But if you want to keep the style of the code block instead of rendering it as a component, you can add the `pure` identifier to specify, the usage is as follows:

````mdx
```tsx pure
function App() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
export default App;
```
````

If you have set `defaultRenderMode` to `'pure'`, Rspress will not render this component by default, but instead display it as a code block. If you want to render a code block as a component in this situation, you can do add the `preview` identifier to specify, the usage is as follows:

````mdx
```tsx preview
function App() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
export default App;
```
````

:::tip Tip
Make sure the document ends with `.mdx`.

### External Components

In addition to writing the component code in the code block of the mdx file, you can also write the component code in an external file, and then import it in the mdx file through the code tag. For example

```md title="example.mdx"
<code src="./Demo.tsx" />
```

```tsx title="Demo.tsx"
export default function App() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
```

External components also need to export the component as default. Through the src attribute of the code tag, you can specify the path of the external component. This plugin supports both relative paths and alias paths(alias).

For some more complex components, this way of using external components will be more convenient.

## Options

This plugin accepts an object parameter of the following type:

```ts
interface PreviewOptions {
  isMobile?: boolean;
  iframePosition?: 'fixed' | 'follow';
  enableCodesandbox?: boolean;
  defaultRenderMode?: 'pure' | 'preview';
}
```

### isMobile

The `isMobile` parameter is used to specify whether the preview mode is mobile mode, defaulting to `false`. The default PC mode display effect is as follows:

### iframePosition

In mobile preview mode, you can use the `iframePosition` parameter to determine the position of the preview area iframe, whether it follows page scrolling (`follow` mode) or is fixed on the page (`fixed` mode), defaulting to `follow`.

The effect of `follow` mode is as follows:

The effect of `fixed` mode is as follows:

### enableCodesandbox

**experimental feature** that enables opening demos in Codesandbox. Currently not supported when `iframePosition` is set to `fixed`.

There are still some limitations with this feature:

- You cannot customize sandbox dependencies: Default dependencies will be only `react`, `react-dom`, and `self`. This means you cannot import other dependencies in your demo,
  and you need to ensure that `self` is published to npm, which is suitable for projects that are modular in nature.
- You cannot customize files: This means you cannot import other files in your demo.

### defaultRenderMode

The default mode of rendering internal code blocks that do not have the `pure` or `preview` identifiers declared by users, defaulting to `preview`.

- `pure`: render as regular code block
- `preview`: render as component
