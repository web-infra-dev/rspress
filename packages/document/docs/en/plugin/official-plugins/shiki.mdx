<SourceCode href="https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspress/tree/main/packages/plugin-shiki" />

Integrated [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) code highlighting plugin. By default, Rspress uses [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) to achieve syntax highlighting. However, in some cases, when you need to implement code highlighting for more languages, Prism.js may not be sufficient, so you can integrate this plugin to use Shiki to support more languages.

:::warning Note

However, after introducing the Shiki plugin, the compilation performance of Rspress will decrease, so please evaluate whether you need to introduce this plugin based on your needs.

## Installation

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rspress/plugin-shiki -D" />

## Usage

First, write the following configuration in the configuration file:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';
import { pluginShiki } from '@rspress/plugin-shiki';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pluginShiki()],
});
```

## Configuration

This plugin supports passing in an object configuration. The properties of this object configuration are as follows:

```ts
import type {
  BuiltinLanguage,
  BuiltinTheme,
  ShikiTransformer,
  SpecialLanguage,
} from 'shiki';

export interface PluginShikiOptions {
  /**
   * Code highlighting theme, @see https://shiki.style/themes
   */
  theme: BuiltinTheme | 'css-variables';
  /**
   * Code highlighting language, @see https://shiki.style/languages
   */
  langs: Array<BuiltinLanguage | SpecialLanguage>;
  /**
   * Custom shiki transformer, @see https://shiki.style/guide/transformers
   */
  transformers: ShikiTransformer[];
}
```

The code highlighting theme uses `css-variables`. You can also choose your favorite theme, refer to the [Shiki theme list documentation](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md) for details.

The default languages supported include `js`, `jsx`, `ts`, `tsx`, `json`, `css`, `scss`, `less`, `xml`, `diff`, `yaml`, `md`, `mdx`, `bash`. If you want to support more languages, you can pass the `langs` attribute in the configuration file. This attribute is an array, each item in the array is an id of a language, refer to the [Shiki-supported language list](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md) for details.

## Transformer concept and usage

Transformer is a concept in this plugin, its function is to transform specific syntax of code blocks, for example, you can use this feature to implement the diff highlighting effect of code blocks.

### Introduction to built-in transformers

A few Transformers are built into this plugin, including:

- `createTransformerLineNumber`: Implement the display of the line number of the code block.

You can enable these Transformers by configuring the `transformers` attribute, such as:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';
import { pluginShiki, createTransformerDiff } from '@rspress/plugin-shiki';
import {
  transformerNotationDiff,
  transformerNotationErrorLevel,
  transformerNotationFocus,
  transformerNotationHighlight,
} from '@shikijs/transformers';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    pluginShiki({
      transformers: [
        // Add as needed
        createTransformerLineNumber(),
        // transformerNotationDiff(),
        // transformerNotationErrorLevel(),
        // transformerNotationHighlight(),
        // transformerNotationFocus(),
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```
