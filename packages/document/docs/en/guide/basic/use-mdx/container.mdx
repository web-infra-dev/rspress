# Container

Containers are a great way to mark important information and provide hints to users.

:::tip
Rspress provides two styles of syntax, [`:::` syntax](#three-colon-syntax) and [GitHub Markdown Alerts syntax](#github-markdown-alerts-syntax).
:::

## `:::` Syntax \{#three-colon-syntax}

You can use the `:::` syntax to create custom containers and support custom titles. For example:

import { Tabs, Tab } from '@theme';

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Rendered Result">

:::note
This is a `block` of type `note`
:::

:::tip
This is a `block` of type `tip`
:::

:::info
This is a `block` of type `info`
:::

:::warning
This is a `block` of type `warning`
:::

:::danger
This is a `block` of type `danger`
:::

:::details
This is a `block` of type `details`
:::

:::tip Custom Title
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

:::tip\{title="Custom Title"}
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

</Tab>

<Tab label="Syntax">

```markdown
:::note
This is a `block` of type `note`
:::

:::tip
This is a `block` of type `tip`
:::

:::info
This is a `block` of type `info`
:::

:::warning
This is a `block` of type `warning`
:::

:::danger
This is a `block` of type `danger`
:::

:::details
This is a `block` of type `details`
:::

:::tip Custom Title
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

:::tip{title="Custom Title"}
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

:::warning

We recommend using the syntax `:::tip Custom Title` directly.

When using the `:::` syntax in `.mdx` files and customizing headings with curly braces syntax, be aware of escaping.

```mdx
:::tip\{title="Custom Title"}

This is a `block` of `Custom Title

::;
```

## GitHub Markdown alerts syntax \{#github-markdown-alerts-syntax}

You can use [GitHub Markdown Alerts Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) to create custom containers.
