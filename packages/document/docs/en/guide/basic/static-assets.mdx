# Static Assets

## Introduction

In Rspress, you may use the following static assets:

- Logo image at the top left corner of the site
- Site favicon icon
- Homepage logo image
- Images, videos and other static assets used in .md(x) files
- Other static assets

Next, we will introduce how to use these static assets one by one.

:::tip Tip

The `document root directory` mentioned below refers to the directory specified by the `root` field in `rspress.config.ts`:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';

export default defineConfig({
  root: 'docs',
});
```

## Top Left Corner Logo

In Rspress, you can specify the logo image at the top left corner through the `logo` field. For example:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';

export default defineConfig({
  logo: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56892468?s=200&v=4',
});
```

The logo field supports both string and object configurations.

When the logo is a string, there are the following config situations:

- Configured as an **external link**, like the above example.
- Configured as an **absolute path**, such as `/rspress-logo.png`. In this case, Rspress will automatically find the `rspress-logo.png` image in the `public directory` of your **document root directory** and display it.
- Configured as a **relative path**, such as `./docs/public/rspress-logo.png`. In this case, Rspress will find the `rspress-logo.png` image based on the project root directory and display it.

If your website needs to adapt to dark mode, you can also use the object configuration of the logo, such as:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';

export default defineConfig({
  logo: {
    light: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56892468?s=200&v=4',
    dark: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56892468?s=200&v=4',
  },
});
```

Here, `light` represents the logo address in light mode, and `dark` represents the logo address in dark mode. Their configuration methods are consistent with the above string configuration.

## Favicon

In Rspress, you can specify the site's favicon icon through the `icon` field. For example:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';

export default defineConfig({
  icon: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56892468?s=200&v=4',
});
```

The icon field supports string config, with the following specific ways:

- Configured as an **external link**, like the above example.
- Configured as an **absolute path**, such as `/favicon.ico`. In this case, Rspress will automatically find the `favicon.ico` icon in the `public directory` of your **document root directory** and display it.
- Configured as a **relative path**, such as `./docs/public/favicon.ico`. In this case, Rspress will find the `favicon.ico` icon based on the project root directory and display it.

## Homepage Logo

In the [frontmatter configuration](/api/config/config-frontmatter.html#hero) of the homepage, you can specify the homepage logo image through the `hero.image.src` field. For example:

```mdx title="index.mdx"
---
pageType: home

hero:
  image:
    src: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56892468?s=200&v=4'
    alt: Rspress
---
```

Here, src is a string, supporting the following configurations:

- Configured as an **external link**, like the above example.
- Configured as an **absolute path**, such as `/rspress-logo.png`. In this case, Rspress will automatically find the `rspress-logo.png` image in the `public directory` of your **document root directory** and display it.

## Static assets Used in .md(x) Files

You can import static assets in `markdown` (or `mdx`) files. Both relative paths and absolute paths are supported. For example, if there is an image in the same directory as the markdown, you can reference it like this:

```mdx
![](./demo.png)
```

Of course, you can also directly use the img tag in `.mdx` files:

```mdx
<img src="./demo.png" />
```

Rspress will automatically find the image based on the `.mdx` file path and image path, and respond to the browser.

On the other hand, you can also import static assets using absolute paths. In this case, Rspress will look for assets in the `public` folder under the `document root directory`.

For example, if the root directory is `docs` and the directory structure is as follows

```bash
docs
├── public
│   └── demo.png
├── index.mdx
```

In the above `index.mdx` file, you can reference `demo.png` like this:

```mdx
![](./public/demo.png)
```

Or use an absolute path to reference:

```mdx
![](/demo.png)
```

Not only images, but you can also import videos, audios and other static assets in markdown files.

## Other Static Assets

In some scenarios, you may need to deploy certain specific static assets, such as adding the deployment configuration file `_headers` of `Netlify` to specify custom HTTP response headers.

In that case, you can directly put these static assets in the `public directory` of the document root directory (such as `docs`). During the project build process, Rspress will automatically **copy all assets in the public directory to the product directory**. In this way, the assets under public can be deployed to the server.
