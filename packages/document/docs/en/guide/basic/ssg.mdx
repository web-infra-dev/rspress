# Static Site Generation

## Introduction

In the production build, Rspress will automatically generate a static site for you, that is, generate the HTML content of each page. After the build is completed, the HTML will appear in the default product directory, such as:

```bash
doc_build
├── static # Static resources
│   ├── main.js
│   └── ...
├── index.html # Home page
├── about.html # About page
├── posts
│   ├── hello-world.html # Article page
│   └── ...
```

You can deploy the contents of this product directory to any static site hosting service, such as Github Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.

## Advantages of SSG

The essence of static site generation is to pre-render components at the build stage, render the components into HTML strings, and then write them into HTML files. This has many benefits, such as:

- Faster FCP, because there is no need to wait for JS to load before rendering.
- More conducive to SEO, because search engine spiders can directly crawl the complete HTML content.

Considering the cost of static site generation, Rspress only pre-renders during production environment builds. In the development environment, it still uses the traditional SPA rendering mode without pre-rendering.

## Adding Custom Site Content

Through `builderConfig.html.tags`, you can customize the site HTML content, such as adding statistical code, adding scripts and styles, etc.

```js title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  builderConfig: {
    html: {
      tags: [
        {
          tag: 'script',
          attrs: {
            src: 'https://cdn.example.com/your-script.js',
          },
        },
        {
          tag: 'link',
          attrs: {
            rel: 'stylesheet',
            href: 'https://cdn.example.com/your-style.css',
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

For more detailed config of `builderConfig.html.tags`, please refer to the [documentation](https://rsbuild.dev/config/options/html.html#htmltags).

## Preview

After the production build is complete, you can preview the output by using the `rspress preview` command. This command will start a local static site service, and you can access this service in your browser to preview the output.

```shell
> rspress preview

Preview server running at http://localhost:4173/
```

## Disabling SSG

If you do not want to use Static Site Generation, you can disable it through the `ssg` config.

```js title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  ssg: false,
});
```

:::warning

Please be cautious when disabling SSG, as this will forfeit many of the advantages of Static Site Generation mentioned above.
