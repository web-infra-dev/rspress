# Customize Search Functions

In some scenarios, we need to customize the search function, such as:

- Processing keywords in the search process, such as removing sensitive words.
- Filtering the default full-text search results.
- Reporting the search keywords.
- Customizing the search data source, such as searching from the database.
- Rendering the custom search data source.
- ......

Faced with these flexible custom requirements, we provide corresponding interfaces to extend the search components of the default theme, making it easy for you to customize the search function.

## Understanding `searchHooks`

In the Rspress config, we provide a `search.searchHooks` config item for configuring the hook functions of the search components, as follows:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  search: {
    searchHooks: path.join(__dirname, './search.tsx'),
  },
});
```

The value of the `search.searchHooks` config item is a file path. This file will export the corresponding hook logic, such as `onSearch`, so that you can customize the capabilities of the search at run time. We can call this file a **`searchHooks` module**.

## Hook Functions in searchHooks

Next, let us introduce the hook functions in searchHooks, namely `beforeSearch`, `onSearch`, `afterRender` and `render`.

:::tip

In the searchHooks module, you only need to export the hook functions you need, instead of necessarily exporting all the hook functions.

:::

### beforeSearch

The `beforeSearch` hook function will be executed before the search starts, you can use it to process the search keywords, such as removing sensitive words, or reporting the search keywords.

> This hook supports asynchronous operations.

Here is an example of usage:

```ts
import type { BeforeSearch } from 'rspress/theme';

const beforeSearch: BeforeSearch = (query: string) => {
  // Some operations before search can be done here
  console.log('beforeSearch');
  // Return the processed query
  return query.replace(' ', '');
};

export { beforeSearch };
```

### onSearch

The `onSearch` hook function will be executed after the default full-text search logic is finished. You can use this hook function to filter or report the search results, or you can add a custom search data source in this hook function.

> This hook supports asynchronous operations.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```ts
import type { OnSearch } from 'rspress/theme';

const onSearch: OnSearch = async (query, defaultSearchResult) => {
  // Can request data based on query
  console.log(query);
  // The results of the default search source, which is an array
  console.log(defaultSearchResult);
  // const customResult = await searchQuery(query);

  // The return value is an array, each item in the array is a search source result
  return [
    {
      group: 'Custom',
      result: {
        list: [
          {
            title: 'Search Result 1',
            path: '/search1',
          },
          {
            title: 'Search Result 2',
            path: '/search2',
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ];
};

export { onSearch };
```

Note that the return value of the `onSearch` hook function is an array, each item in the array is a search source result, and each item has the following structure:

```ts
{
  group: string; // The group name of the search result, which will be displayed in the search results.
  result: unknown;
}
```

The `result` is the search result, you can customize its internal structure and render it in the following `render` hook.

### afterSearch

The `afterSearch` hook function will be executed after the search result is rendered. You can get the final search keywords and search results in this hook.

> This hook supports asynchronous operations.

Here is an example of usage:

```ts
import type { AfterSearch } from 'rspress/theme';

const afterSearch: AfterSearch = async (query, searchResult) => {
  // Search keyword
  console.log(query);
  // Search result
  console.log(searchResult);
};

export { afterSearch };
```

### render

The `render` function will render the custom search source data in your `onSearch` hook. Therefore, it generally needs to be used together with `onSearch`. Here's how to use it:

```ts
import type { RenderSearchFunction } from 'rspress/theme';

// The above OnSearch hook implementation is skipped

interface ResultData {
  list: {
    title: string;
    path: string;
  }[];
}

// The render function for each search source
const render: RenderSearchFunction<ResultData> = item => {
  return (
    <div>
      {item.list.map(i => (
        <div>
          <a href={i.path}>{i.title}</a>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export { onSearch, render };
```

The result is as follows:
