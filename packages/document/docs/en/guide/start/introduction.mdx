# Introduction

## Position

Rspress is a static site generator based on [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/), with a built-in default documentation theme. You can quickly build a documentation site with Rspress, and also customize the theme to meet your personalized static site needs, such as blog sites, product homepages, etc.

The design goals of Rspress are: **first-class compilation performance**, **out-of-the-box theme functionality**, and **sufficiently flexible extensibility**.

## Features

### High-performance Rust Toolchain

In Rspress, in order to break through the compilation performance bottleneck of traditional front-end tools, we have made a lot of efforts on the Rust toolchain and Rspress has obvious advantages in compilation performance compared to other SSG frameworks, the following is benchmark comparison:

import { Benchmark } from '@/components/Benchmark';

<Benchmark />

Firstly, Rspress is built on [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/), a high-performance front-end packaging tool based on Rust, which has built-in various optimization methods, such as multi-threaded parallel compilation, incremental compilation, etc. Compared with traditional packaging tools like Webpack, Rollup, etc., Rspack's compilation speed has increased by 5 ~ 10 times.

In addition to the bundler itself, for another major compilation performance bottleneck in the SSG framework, i.e., `Markdown Compilation`, we have also rustified this process to further speed up. Based on the open-source [mdxjs-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/mdxjs-rs) library, we extended a series of plugins, and further exposed the Node.js call interface through [napi-rs](https://napi.rs/), thus customizing the Rspress Markdown compiler (called [`@rspress/mdx-rs`](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/mdx-rs)). This compiler has more than 10 times the performance improvement compared to the traditional JS version of the compiler:

### Support for MDX Rendering

Rspress uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to extend Markdown syntax, supports using React components in Markdown, and also supports using JSX syntax in Markdown, making the syntax more flexible:

Embedding React components in pages can make your documents richer, such as:

> Case source: https://modernjs.dev/community/showcase.html

For syntax details, please refer to the [Using MDX](/guide/basic/use-mdx) section.

### Theme Functionality

#### Full-text Search Support

Based on the open-source FlexSearch search engine, it provides out-of-the-box document search capabilities, which means you can use the search function directly without any configuration. The effect is as follows:

#### I18n Support

Built-in support for internationalization, supports switching between multiple languages, and supports searching for content in multiple languages. Details can be seen in [I18n](/guide/default-theme/i18n).

#### Code Block Highlighting

Based on [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) for runtime code coloring, it supports highlighting of multiple code languages. For example:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';

export default defineConfig({
  root: 'docs',
});
```

#### Automatic Layout Generation

It has built-in various layout components, such as `top navigation`, `left sidebar`, etc. You can generate them automatically through the configuration file. For details, please refer to [Automated Navigation Bar/Sidebar](/guide/basic/auto-nav-sidebar).

At the same time, you can also customize the layout type by configuring pageType. For details, please refer to [pageType](/api/config/config-frontmatter.html#pagetype).

#### Custom Theme Support

Supports custom themes, you can customize the theme through the configuration file. For details, please refer to [Custom Themes](/guide/advanced/custom-theme).

### Plugin Mechanism

An internal plugin system is designed to ensure strong extensibility. You can extend various functions of Rspress by customizing plugins. For details, please refer to [Plugin Mechanism](/plugin/system/introduction).
