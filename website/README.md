# Rspress website

## Contributing

Currently Rspress provides documentation in English and Chinese. If you can use Chinese, please update both documents at the same time. Otherwise, just update the English documentation.

## Writing style guide

The same as Rspack: [Writing style guide](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/tree/main/website#writing-style-guide).

### Image assets

For images you use in the document, it's better to upload them to the [rspack-contrib/rstack-design-resources](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rstack-design-resources) repository, so the size of the current repository doesn't get too big.

After you upload the images there, they will be automatically deployed under the <https://assets.rspack.rs/>.
