# HomeFeature

This component is part of the [homepage](/guide/basic/home-page). `HomeFeature` renders a feature grid below the Hero section on the homepage.

## Usage

Modify or override through [custom theme](/guide/basic/custom-theme).

You can configure `features` in the frontmatter of your mdx file, and the component will automatically read it through [`useFrontmatter`](/ui/hooks/use-frontmatter). For detailed configuration options, refer to [Frontmatter Configuration](/api/config/config-frontmatter#features).

```tsx preview
import { HomeFeature as BasicHomeFeature } from '@rspress/core/theme-original';

export default function HomeFeature() {
  return <BasicHomeFeature />;
}
```

## Props

### features

- **Type:** `Feature[]`
- **Default:** Read from frontmatter

```ts
interface Feature {
  /** Feature icon, supports emoji or HTML string */
  icon: string;
  /** Feature title */
  title: string;
  /** Feature description, supports HTML string */
  details: string;
  /** Grid column span, supports 2, 3, 4, 6, defaults to 4 */
  span?: 2 | 3 | 4 | 6;
  /** Link to navigate when clicking the card */
  link?: string;
}
```

- `span` controls how many grid columns each card occupies, total 12 columns
- `icon` and `details` support HTML strings
- Setting `link` makes the card clickable for navigation
