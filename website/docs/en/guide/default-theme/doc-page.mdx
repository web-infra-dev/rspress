# Doc page

## Page type

You can specify the pageType in the `frontmatter` metadata to use different layouts in the page. By default, the pageType of the document is `doc`, so the `sidebar` on the left and the `outline ` on the right will appear by default. If you don't need these, you can set pageType to `custom`:

```yaml
---
pageType: custom
---
```

## Sidebar

In `rspress.config.ts`, you can configure the content of the sidebar, for details, please refer to [Sidebar Config](/api/config/config-theme#sidebar).
