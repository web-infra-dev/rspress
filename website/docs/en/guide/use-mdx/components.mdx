# MDX and React components

Rspress supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a content authoring format that seamlessly combines Markdown with JSX. MDX allows you to use React components directly in your documentation, combining Markdown's concise syntax with the power of the React ecosystem, making it ideal for building interactive, component-based technical documentation.

## What is MDX

MDX is a combination of Markdown and JSX syntax, allowing you to write and use React components directly in Markdown documents.

We recommend using `.mdx` for all documentation files, which enables you to write content just like regular Markdown and also import and utilize the [built-in components](/ui/components/index.mdx) provided by Rspress.

```mdx
# Hello, world!

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@rspress/core/theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rspress@latest" />
```

## Componentization \{#component}

In MDX, every `.mdx` file is compiled into a React component, which means it can be imported like any component and can freely render React components. For example:

import { Tabs, Tab } from '@theme';
import { Border } from '../../../components/Border';

<Tabs>
<Tab label="docs/index.mdx">

```mdx
import MdxFragment from './_mdx-fragment.mdx';
import TsxComponent from './_tsx-component';

Testing the use of MDX fragments and React components.

<MdxFragment />

<TsxComponent />
```

</Tab>

<Tab label="docs/_mdx-fragment.mdx">

```mdx file="./_mdx-fragment.mdx"

```

</Tab>

<Tab label="docs/_tsx-component.tsx">

```tsx file="./_tsx-component.tsx"

```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

It will be rendered as:

import MdxFragment from './_mdx-fragment.mdx';
import TsxComponent from './_tsx-component';

<Border>

<MdxFragment />

<TsxComponent />
</Border>

You can use [built-in components](/ui/components/index.mdx) provided by Rspress or install some React component libraries to enrich your documentation in `.mdx` files.

## Routing convention

import RouteConvention from '@en/fragments/route-convention.mdx';

<RouteConvention />

## Escape Hatch: writing document content in tsx

```tsx file="./_escape-hatch.tsx" title="_escape-hatch.tsx"

```

import EscapeHatch from './_escape-hatch';

It will be rendered as:

<Border>
  <EscapeHatch />
</Border>

:::warning

tsx and html syntax can make it difficult to extract static information, such as local search indexes.

It is more recommended to use `.mdx` files to write document content and use `.tsx` files to write interactive dynamic content.
