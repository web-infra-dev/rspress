# Frontmatter

You can add front matter at the beginning of your Markdown file. It is a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) block wrapped by the three dashes `---` and is used to define metadata.

For example, use [title](/api/config/config-frontmatter#title) to specify the title of the page:

```yaml
---
title: Hello world
---
```

You can also access properties defined in front matter in the body, for example:

```markdown
---
title: Hello world
---

# {frontmatter.title}
```

The properties defined above are passed to the component as `frontmatter`. So the final output will be:

```html
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```

See [Front matter config](/api/config/config-frontmatter) for available front matter configurations.
