# Frontmatter

You can add front matter at the beginning of your Markdown file, which is a special part that uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format to define metadata, and is included in the file's top three dashes `---`.

For example, use [title](/api/config/config-frontmatter#title) to specify the title of the page:

```yaml
---
title: Hello world
---
```

You can also access properties defined in front matter in the body, for example:

```markdown
---
title: Hello world
---

# {frontmatter.title}
```

The previously defined properties will be passed to the component as `frontmatter` properties. So the final output will be:

```html
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```

See [Front matter config](/api/config/config-frontmatter) for available front matter configurations.
