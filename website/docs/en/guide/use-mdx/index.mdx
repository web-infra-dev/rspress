# Use MDX

Rspress supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a powerful way to develop content.

## Markdown

MDX is a superset of Markdown, which means you can write Markdown files as usual. For example:

```md
# Hello world
```

## Customizing anchor id

By default, Rspress will automatically generate ids based on the content of each title. This id will also serve as the content of the anchor. You can use the following syntax to customize the id of the header:

```md
## Hello world {#custom-id}
```

Where `custom-id` is your custom id.
