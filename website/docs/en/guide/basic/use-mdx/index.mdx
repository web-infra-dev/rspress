# Use MDX

Rspress supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a powerful way to develop content.

## Markdown

MDX is a superset of Markdown, which means you can write Markdown files as usual. For example:

```md
# Hello world
```

## Use component

When you want to use React components in Markdown files, you should name your files with `.mdx` extension. For example:

```mdx title="index.mdx"
import { CustomComponent } from './custom';

# Hello world

<CustomComponent />
```

All mdx files are also components and they can import each other:

```mdx
import Foo from './shared/foo.mdx';

# Hello world

<Foo />
```

::: tip

Relevant components need to be excluded from routing meta info through [route.exclude](/api/config/config-basic#routeexclude) configuration.

You can also place components in an adjacent directory outside [root](/api/config/config-basic#root). For example:

```mdx
// <cwd>/docs/index.mdx
import { Button } from '../components/button';

# Button

<Button />

// <cwd>/components/button.mdx
export Button = () => <button />;
```

:::

## Front matter

You can add front matter at the beginning of your Markdown file, which is a special part that uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format to define metadata, and is included in the file's top three dashes `---`.

For example, use [title](/api/config/config-frontmatter#title) to specify the title of the page:

```yaml
---
title: Hello world
---
```

You can also access properties defined in front matter in the body, for example:

```markdown
---
title: Hello world
---

# {frontmatter.title}
```

The previously defined properties will be passed to the component as `frontmatter` properties. So the final output will be:

```html
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```

:::tip
See [Front matter config](/api/config/config-frontmatter) for available front matter configurations.

## Code block

### Basic usage

You can use the \`\`\` syntax to create code blocks and support custom titles. For example:

**Input:**

````md
```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

```js title="hello.js"
console.log('Hello World');
```
````

**Output:**

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

```js title="hello.js"
console.log('Hello World');
```

### Show line numbers

If you want to display line numbers, you can enable the `showLineNumbers` option in the config file:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
export default {
  // ...
  markdown: {
    showLineNumbers: true,
  },
};
```

### Wrap code

If you want to wrap long code line by default, you can enable the `defaultWrapCode` option in the config file:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
export default {
  // ...
  markdown: {
    defaultWrapCode: true,
  },
};
```

### Line highlighting

You can also apply line highlighting and code block title at the same time, for example:

**Input:**

````md
```js title="hello.js"
console.log('Hello World'); // [\!code highlight]

// [\!code highlight:3]
const a = 1;

console.log(a);

const b = 2;

console.log(b);
```
````

:::warning
The backslash (`\`) in `[\!code highlight]` is for Markdown escaping to display the raw syntax. Do not include it when using this notation in your actual code.
:::

**Output:**

```js title="hello.js"
console.log('Hello World'); // [!code highlight]

// [!code highlight:3]
const a = 1;

console.log(a);

const b = 2;

console.log(b);
```

## Customizing anchor id

By default, Rspress will automatically generate ids based on the content of each title. This id will also serve as the content of the anchor. You can use the following syntax to customize the id of the header:

```md
## Hello world {#custom-id}
```

Where `custom-id` is your custom id.

## Disabling the Rust version compiler

In default mode, Rspress uses the Rust version of the MDX compiler, which is faster than the JavaScript version. However, the Rust version of the compiler does not support custom plugins.

If you need to add a custom MDX compiler plugin, you can disable the Rust version of the MDX compiler through the following config and switch to the JavaScript version of the compiler:
