# Customize themes with wrap and eject

This page follows Rspress [custom theme](/ui/custom-theme) and Docusaurus [Swizzling](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling) ideas to explain how to override built-in components and clarify the difference between wrap and eject.

## `theme/index.tsx`: override built-ins via re-export

Rspress loads the theme from `theme/index.tsx` at the project root. You can use **ESM re-export** here to override default exports or same-name components; any internal usage will prefer your re-exported version:

```tsx title="theme/index.tsx"
import { Layout as BasicLayout } from '@rspress/core/theme-original';

const Layout = () => <BasicLayout beforeNavTitle={<div>some content</div>} />;

export { Layout };

export * from '@rspress/core/theme-original';
```

- `Layout` is the theme entry; Rspress auto-loads it. By exporting a same-name component you can wrap or replace the default.
- `export * from '@rspress/core/theme-original'` keeps other default exports available while your overrides take effect.
- This capability underpins all customization: you may simply wrap defaults or swap in your own implementations before re-exporting.

## Wrap: add props/slots on top of re-exports

Wrap means extending the re-exported components with extra props, e.g., using `Layout` slots:

- No need to touch theme source; upgrading the default theme only requires maintaining your custom props/slots.
- Best for light tweaks, slot fills, or replacing a few same-name components.

## Eject: copy source then edit directly

Eject uses the CLI `rspress eject` to copy `@rspress/core/theme-original` source into your project so you can edit it directly:

- Produces an editable local copy, enabling deep customization of internal logic.
- Decouples from upstream updates; you must sync changes manually when upgrading.

## Recommendations

- **Prefer Wrap**: wrap + re-export in `theme/index.tsx`, leveraging props/slots/same-name exports for overrides with low upgrade cost.
- **Consider Eject**: only when Wrap can’t cover deep changes (e.g., altering internal logic) should you run `rspress eject`.
