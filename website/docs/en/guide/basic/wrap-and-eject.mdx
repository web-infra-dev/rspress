# Customize themes with wrap and eject

In simple terms: `theme/index.tsx` can re-export and replace built-in components. After that you have two paths—**wrap (no source edits, pass props/slots)** or **eject (copy source, edit freely)**. See [custom theme](/ui/custom-theme) for more examples.

## `theme/index.tsx`: override built-ins via re-export

Rspress loads the theme from `theme/index.tsx` at the project root. You can use **ESM re-export** here to override default exports or same-name components; any internal usage will prefer your re-exported version:

```tsx title="theme/index.tsx"
import { Layout as BasicLayout } from '@rspress/core/theme-original';

const Layout = () => <BasicLayout beforeNavTitle={<div>some content</div>} />;

export { Layout };

export * from '@rspress/core/theme-original';
```

- `Layout` is the theme entry; Rspress auto-loads it. By exporting a same-name component you can wrap or replace the default.
- `export * from '@rspress/core/theme-original'` keeps other default exports available while your overrides take effect.
- This capability underpins all customization: you may simply wrap defaults or swap in your own implementations before re-exporting.

## Wrap: add props/slots on top of re-exports

Wrap means extending the re-exported components with extra props, e.g., using `Layout` slots:

- No source edits: just wrap in `theme/index.tsx` and pass props/slots to built-ins.
- Great for light tweaks: style nits, slot content, or swapping a few same-name components.

## Eject: copy source then edit directly

Eject uses the CLI `rspress eject` to copy `@rspress/core/theme-original` source into your project so you can edit it directly:

- Gives you source: `rspress eject` copies theme source locally so you can change internals.
- You maintain it: decoupled from upstream; you must sync updates yourself when upgrading.

## Recommendations

- **Prefer Wrap**: safer, easier to upgrade, covers most style/slot needs.
- **Consider Eject**: only when you must change internals that Wrap can’t cover.
