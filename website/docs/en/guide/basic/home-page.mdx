## Home components

The Rspress Home page consists of these components, which you can customize via eject:

- [HomeHero](/ui/layout-components/home-hero)
- [HomeFeature](/ui/layout-components/home-feature)
- [HomeFooter](/ui/layout-components/home-footer)
- [HomeBackground](/ui/layout-components/home-background)

:::tip

You can also customize the entire homepage directly by overriding the [`HomeLayout`](/ui/layout-components/home-layout) component. If you do this, it should be noted that the homepage related configuration and these frontmatter fields will not take effect.
