# Runtime API

Rspress exposes runtime APIs to help you compose custom UI or behaviors at build time and in the browser.

## React hooks

Each hook has its own dedicated guide under [UI Hooks](/ui/hooks):

- [`usePageData`](/ui/hooks/use-page-data): Access page metadata such as title, route, and frontmatter.
- [`useLang`](/ui/hooks/use-lang): Read the active locale and react to language switches.
- [`useVersion`](/ui/hooks/use-version): Retrieve the current docs version in multi-version setups.
- [`useDark`](/ui/hooks/use-dark): Detect whether dark mode is enabled.
- [`useI18n`](/ui/hooks/use-i18n): Render localized text from the configured source.
- [`Router hooks`](/ui/hooks/router-hooks): Use `react-router-dom` hooks re-exported by Rspress, such as `useLocation` and `useNavigate`.

> See also [Internationalization](/guide/default-theme/i18n) for more details on `useI18n`.
